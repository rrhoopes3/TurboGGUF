"""PolarQuant: Random rotation + optimal scalar quantization.

Algorithm 1 from the TurboQuant paper (ICLR 2026).

After random rotation, coordinates follow a known Beta distribution (Gaussian in
high d), enabling optimal scalar quantization per coordinate independently.

Important: codebook is calibrated for unit-norm vectors. For non-unit-norm inputs,
we extract norms, normalize, quantize, then rescale on dequantization.
(Paper page 5: "store the L2 norms in floating-point precision and rescale")
